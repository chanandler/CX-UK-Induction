| 2026-06-02 | ✅ PlaceholderViews.swift | BUG-023 fixed — Induction flow now displays induction image assets in a paged flow with next/confirm actions instead of only showing a slide count |
| 2026-06-02 | ✅ Models.swift + WelcomeView.swift | BUG-024 fixed — SwiftData save failures now roll back pending context changes so failed inserts/edits/deletes cannot leak into later successful saves |
| 2026-06-02 | ✅ PlaceholderViews.swift + WelcomeView.swift | BUG-025 fixed — Pre-Registration Admin add form now only clears after a confirmed successful save, preserving entered data when persistence fails |
| 2026-06-02 | ✅ PlaceholderViews.swift | BUG-026 fixed — induction registration now opens the pre-filled handwritten signature sheet again before completing the sign-in flow |
| 2026-06-02 | ✅ PlaceholderViews.swift + WelcomeView.swift | BUG-027 fixed — settings admin action renamed from misleading "Sign Out Now" to "Lock Admin Session" because it only invalidates the PIN session |

## Completed UI Improvements (2026-03-24)

| Date | Area | Change |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-03-24 | ✅ 'WelcomeView` — `BrandHeader` | Logo now displayed on a white rounded-rect backing with shadow so it is clearly visible against the dark CEMEX blue gradient |
| 2026-03-24 | ✅ 'WelcomeView` — `BrandHeader` | Added a light blue-grey accent strip (`#DCE6F8` → system grouped background) below the blue band to provide visual contrast and a smoother transition into the form card |
| 2026-03-24 | ✅ 'WelcomeView` — `InductionFlowView` | Replaced the tick-box acknowledgement with a **"Tap here to sign"** button that opens a full-height signature sheet |
| 2026-03-24 | ✅ 'WelcomeView` — `InductionSignatureSheet` (new) | New sheet presents a clear "Confirm Understanding" heading, body text, and the visitor's first + last name rendered in `BradleyHandITCTT-Bold` (closest built-in iOS equivalent to Kalam) at 58pt with a spring-in animation |
| 2026-03-24 | ✅ 'WelcomeView` — `InductionSignatureSheet` | "I Agree" button triggers `onComplete(true)` directly — the registration confirmation alert fires immediately without any intermediate screen |
| 2026-03-24 | ✅ `WelcomeView` — `InductionFlowView` | Removed intermediate "Signed by / Confirm and Continue" step; `isSigned` state deleted; flow is now: slides → sign sheet → confirmation alert |

## Enhancement Ideas (New)

- Consolidate alert/sheet presentation in WelcomeView via a single enum-driven router to reduce state coupling and race conditions.
- Extract pager management into a small `PagerManager` helper (usedPagers, recentlyFreedPagers grace window, issue/return helpers) to simplify WelcomeView.
- Add accessibility labels/hints for critical buttons (Register, I'm Leaving, Fire Alarm Roll Call) and ensure minimum hit size.
- Localize remaining hardcoded strings in AdminAndUtilitiesViews.swift (e.g., "Import Preview", "Confirm", "Cancel", etc.).
- Consider adding unit tests using Swift Testing for CSV parsing edge cases and duplicate detection logic.
- Add a small `Theme` layer for light/dark tokens and reuse across VisitorTabs cards and WelcomeView cards.
- Add structured analytics export (JSON) alongside CSV for downstream processing.
- Consider using `.task(id:)` cancellation tokens for kiosk banner/checkout banner to guarantee cleanup on state change.
- Review backup retention policy (30 days) as a setting surfaced in Settings.
- Consider a small `AppStrings` centralization for common labels and reuse across flows.
