## Priority Legend
- 🔴 **CRITICAL** — Bug, crash risk, or data loss
- 🟠 **HIGH** — Significant issue impacting correctness or user experience
- 🟡 **MEDIUM** — Performance or code quality issue
- 🟢 **LOW** — Minor improvement or style issue

## Open Issues

### VisitorTabs.swift

### WelcomeView.swift

### Models.swift

- [ ] 🟠 **CSV import breaks quoted multiline fields due pre-splitting by newline** — `previewImport` splits raw CSV using `components(separatedBy: CharacterSet.newlines)` before row parsing (`Models.swift:213`), but `parseCSVLine` only parses a single line (`Models.swift:338`). Any valid quoted field containing embedded newlines will be split into multiple pseudo-rows, producing false failures and potential data corruption. Implement a record-level parser that respects quote state across line breaks before field tokenization.

### PINSecurity.swift

- [ ] 🟡 **PIN verification has no brute-force throttling or lockout** — `PinGateSheet.submit()` allows unlimited rapid retries (`PINSecurity.swift:144`) with immediate feedback and no cooldown. Because this gate protects settings/export/sign-in-book/fire roll-call/admin analytics, add attempt throttling (e.g. exponential backoff, temporary lockout after N failures, and optional persistent fail counter) to reduce brute-force risk on unattended kiosks.
